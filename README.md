# 👋 Hi, I’m Pablo Burgos
Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Linux | Python | SIEM | SQL

## 🚀 Professional Statement
I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a solid foundation in Linux, SQL, Python, and SIEM tools, gained through the Coursera Foundations of Cybersecurity course. My strengths include strong analytical thinking and meticulous attention to detail, both of which are essential for identifying and mitigating risks. I value ethical responsibility, continuous learning, and teamwork.

Through the course, I honed my skills in SQL for database querying, Python scripting for automation, and hands-on work with SIEM and network protocol analysis. I applied this knowledge in portfolio activities such as analyzing vulnerabilities, using packet capture tools, and drafting incident response plans.

I am driven by a desire to protect digital assets and support organizational security goals. I aim to work in a SOC analyst role where I can contribute by detecting threats, responding to incidents, and continuously improving cybersecurity defenses.
